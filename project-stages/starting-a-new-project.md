Please note: You can also find the setup instructions of our WordPress stack at its own GitHub repository section [dudestack/instructions](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack-instructions).

### Introduction

Even though our ways are mostly automated, there are some tasks that are not worth of automating in sake of effectiveness. The developers that jump in later are not able to use the project starting commands, therefore some things need attention separately as per [How to continue developing a project that has been already started](https://handbook.dude.fi/wordpress-kehitys/projektin-aloitus#:\~:text=Projektin%20aloitus-,My%C3%B6hemmin%20projektiin%20mukaan%20tulevat,-Hand%20off%20suunnittelijalta).
