### PHP back-end development <a href="#taustakehitys" id="taustakehitys"></a>

In PHP development we use the official [WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/) and WordPress Theme Coding Standards with some exceptions. You can see the exceptions in our [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light/blob/master/phpcs.xml) but besides this we have some project-based rules.
