## Development at Dude

You are browsing the technical development handbook of Dude, the Finnish digital agency. This handbook is supposed to be helpful for both internal and external members of Dude. It consists of best practices, code snippets, setup documentation, server-side commands and all things in between. Enjoy!

#### Base for development

We are committed to keep this handbook under continuous development. If we notice issues in our tech, workflow, DevOps or anything related, we will improve on those areas. If you have any suggestions to this handbook, please send them to roni@dude.fi. Thanks!

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: As most of this documentation includes pretty common best practices, it may also have something strictly specific to our company culture. It may not be easily followed by a external member of our community so please advice.
