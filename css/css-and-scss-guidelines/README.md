# CSS Guidelines

Dude uses SCSS and modern CSS for styles. Our way of doing cascading style sheets is our own hybrid that is based on [SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)](https://smacss.com/) and the style guide used by [Gutenberg](https://css-tricks.com/styling-the-gutenberg-columns-block/) by WordPress. Practically this brings us the `is-*` and `has-*` naming conventions in selectors.

The Guidelines are based on stylelint standards we have defined. Our stylelint config extends `stylelint-config-standard` and `stylelint-config-recommended-scss`. View the full .stylelintrc here:
